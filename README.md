# Note Taker
An application that allows users to save notes that will be placed into a db.json file and rerendered onto the page.

## Description

- I was motivated to create this application because it was a great opportunity to test my abilities with express.js and creating routes to the connect with the frontend and write to a file in the backend.
- I created this project to work on my Node JS, Express.js, and general Javascript skills, particularly when it comes to using routes to connect with the front end and transfer data between the two.
- By creating this application, I solved the problem of needing a place for a user to store their notes. Now they can save their notes here and revisit them later to review.
- Through doing this activity, I learned more about using javascript in Node JS and using Express.js to create a server that talks with the front end.

## Installation

- There is no installation required for this application, the user simply needs to use this link and they can use the application:

## Usage

- The use of this application is to add notes to a page that will be saved in a json file.

- When the user accesses the URL and is taken to the page, they will first have to select that they would like to get started with writing or viewing notes
- When a user enters in a new note, they can save that note and it will appear on the left side of the page.
- The user can also click on notes on the left side of the page in order to review them and have them appear in the main area
